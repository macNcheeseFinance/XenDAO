 <h4>What is Xen DAO?</h4>
                     
Xen DAO is a tool that allows you to mass mint XEN. There are 2 tools available. A batch minter(smart contract) and in-browser wallet generator&minter.

Smart contract is more convenient, but costs more gas. Wallet minter is cheaper, but takes a few extra step.


<h4>Benefits of using the Tool</h4>						In addition to claiming XEN, you will also earn Xen DAO(XD) token. </br></br>

<h4>Economic Model</h4>		The DAO collects a small fee from each claimed wallet. 100% of the fees collected are distributed to XD stakers.</br></br>

<h4>Xen DAO Staking</h4>
 Xen DAO holders can stake their tokens & earn rewards from fees in native tokens(ETH/BNB/MATIC/...). </br></br>
			
						
<h4>Xen DAO Tokenomics</h4>
 Xen DAO(XD) token can only be minted until 15th of January 2023. Daily inflation starts reducing from day 14 onwards. 0 inflation is reached on 15th January</br></br>
 
 <h4>No Premine</h4>
 Xen DAO has no "premine". Supply starts at 0. </br></br>
			
			
<h4>Referrals earn Extra</h4>			
						You can also referr other users and earn 20% of their XD reward. Invitee receives a 25% XD bonus on their mint. <small>(<a href="referral.php">Click to referr</a>)</small></br></br>

 
<h4>Xen DAO Long Term Value</h4>
 Xen DAO is a smart contract that allows mass XEN minting and the distribution of collected rewards to XD stakers. There is no roadmap and no future development. </br>The main purpose of Xen DAO is to create a safe batch minting environment with extra rewards. It is not meant to serve as an investment. Beware that the XEN token itself is hyperinflationary which could lead to tokens becoming worthless.</br></br>

 
 

<h4>Xen DAO Security</h4>
 Xen DAO is an experimental software. Source code can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/macNcheeseFinance/XenDAO/blob/main/XENDAO.sol" target="_blank">Github</a>. While it's most likely safe and secure to use and has been audited by a peer, there have been no audits from a professional auditing firm. Use at your own risk.</br></br>
